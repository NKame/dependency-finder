A user pointed out to me that they were not able to analyse some Lucene files.
I determined that the files contained new constant pool entries for Java 7/8 and
quickly added support for them in the =com.jeantessier.classreader= package.
This way, we can at the very least parse the files.  The support is very
barebone for now, only printing them out in logs and as part of =ClassReader=.
After reading about it, I think there are also new attributes that I'll have to
look into.

I realized that the installation instructions still reference Sun Microsystems.
I should update them to point to Oracle instead.
