Figured out how to let Gradle know where to find the classes for Javadoc Doclets
with the following dependency in =build.gradle=:

    compile files(org.gradle.internal.jvm.Jvm.current().toolsJar)

It adds =tools.jar= to the compiler's classpath.  It which contains the
=com.sun.*= classes used by the Doclet code.
