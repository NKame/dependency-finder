Moved the project hosting to
[[http://github.com/jeantessier/dependency-finder][GitHub]].

I can use GitHub Pages to host the project's website, so I moved the older
=website= folder to the =gh-pages= branch and moved everything in the older
=DependencyFinder= folder up one level.  GitHub Pages cannot run CGI scripts, so
I will have to find an alternative for the Journal.

I will also need to change references to SourceForge from the pages and fix
deployment instructions.
